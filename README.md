# ACPKM-kuznechik

I made a rust implementation of [my previous attempt in python](https://github.com/forentfraps/ACPKM-kuznechik). You can find all the explanations there. 

Basic idea and control examples could be found here [GOST 2015.pdf](https://github.com/forentfraps/ACPKM-kuznechik/files/9097518/GOST.2015.pdf)

Goal of this project was to achieve a speed improvement (Turned out to be like 5x times faster) and to learn basic concepts of a new language
